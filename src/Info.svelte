    This tool was made to be utilised for <a href="http://github.com/dwivedithedev/" target="blank">Learningin.tech</a> but it 
    felt like a good project in itself!<br/>
    If this helped you, let me know about it on <a href="http://twitter.com/vaibhavthevedi/" target="blank">Twitter</a>. Have a good day! ❤️
