- You should update the icons in `/public/images/icons`
- For an offline experience edit the `/public/offline.html` file.
- This PWA is installable, the `/public/scripts/install.js` file has the install configuration. You should change the app name in the `logAppInstalled` function.

Note: If you don't want to make the app installable you can remove the script from the `index.html` file in the `public` folder.
